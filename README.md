## Development Process :
- I created a wireframe on paper to have a clear idea of what structure to build.
- I built the initial HTML body structure and its responsive layout.
- I started styling the page with pixelated and retro fonts and settled on a color palette of black and neon colors.
- Once I started working on the JavaScript code, I had to change a few elements in the HTML within the game window. I deleted the answer buttons so they could appear dynamically through JavaScript, and I added IDs to them for styling.
- I struggled to find a way to randomize the position of the correct answer (so it wouldn’t always be answer A). I tried using the modulo operator (%) for a while but eventually settled on using Math.random().
- I tested multiple ways to loop through the questions and answers in the array and finally added a currentQuestion++ mechanism at the end of my function.
- I added a temporary end condition to make testing easier, so I wouldn’t have to answer 10 correct questions every time.
- I then fixed the score display and score value, as the score section on the page was not updating with correct answers.
